ðŸ“±Content:

The price of a cell phone, which has become a necessity in our daily lives, varies widely depending on its specifications. In this notebook, we will explore the factors that affect cell phone prices and predict new samples based on the best model.

ðŸ“±This notebook includes the following:

Preprocessing
Data cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Preparing the data to train a model
Training and making predictions using various classification models
Model evaluation
Using various ensemble learning methods
ðŸ“±Objective:

Our objective is to predict the price range of a mobile phone by building a model that takes into account various features provided in the dataset. We will be using supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the best model for this problem.

ðŸ“±What Problem We Have?

Our task is to perform a classification on the target variable "Price Range" based on the data and attribute information. To achieve the best possible classification, we will develop a model that accurately predicts the price range of mobile phones.

ðŸ“”Problem Statement:

The goal of this problem is not to predict the actual price of a mobile phone, but rather to determine a price range that indicates how high the price could be. With your help, Bob can gain a better understanding of the market and set competitive prices for his products.
